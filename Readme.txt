Introduction
This project demonstrates how to set up and use the ESP32-CAM module for face recognition. The ESP32-CAM is a low-cost development board with a camera, suitable for IoT applications.

Features:

Real-time face detection
Face recognition
Easy setup and configuration
Web-based interface for viewing camera feed
Hardware Requirements
ESP32-CAM module
FTDI programmer (for uploading code)
Breadboard and jumper wires
Optional: External antenna for better Wi-Fi range
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
ESP32 Board Package
Required libraries: ESP32, ESPAsyncWebServer, AsyncTCP, ArduinoJson
Installation
Setting Up the ESP32-CAM
Install the ESP32 Board Package:

Open the Arduino IDE.
Go to File > Preferences.
Add the following URL to the "Additional Board Manager URLs" field: https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json.
Go to Tools > Board > Board Manager.
Search for "ESP32" and install the latest version.
Install Required Libraries:

In the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Search for and install ESPAsyncWebServer, AsyncTCP, and ArduinoJson.
Connect the ESP32-CAM to FTDI Programmer:

Connect the ESP32-CAM's U0T to FTDI's TX, U0R to RX, GND to GND, 5V to VCC.
Connect GND to IO0 to put the ESP32-CAM in flashing mode.
Upload the Code:

Open the provided sketch (e.g., ESP32_CAM_Face_Recognition.ino) in the Arduino IDE.
Select the correct board and port from Tools > Board and Tools > Port.
Click on the upload button.
Usage
Power Up the ESP32-CAM:

Once the code is uploaded, disconnect IO0 from GND and press the reset button on the ESP32-CAM.
Access the Web Interface:

Open a serial monitor to find the IP address assigned to the ESP32-CAM.
Open a web browser and enter the IP address to access the camera feed.
Face Recognition:

The web interface will show the camera feed with detected faces highlighted.
Follow the on-screen instructions to register faces.
